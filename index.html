    <h1>The Beginning of the Xbox</h1>
        <p class = one>The <i>Xbox</i> started out when a group of designers came to Bill Gates asking if
            they could release a hardware device made just for gaming. Bill Gates agreed,
            since Microsoft wanted a stake in the newly rising gaming industry, that was
            primarily controlled by the playstation 2, the proposed "<i>xbox</i>" would have almost 
            double the hardware capabilities of the PS2, and would help solidify <i>xbox</i> in 
            the gaming market. Upon release, <i>xbox</i> was an instant success in America. In that
            time, Microsoft made one of the best decisions for the companies future, which was 
            to buy Bungie, a game company that had created halo. Upon release to the <i>Xbox</i> as 
            a first person game, it became an instant success. Halo was by far one of the most popular
            games on the <i>Xbox</i> exlusively, and helped build its brand. At a $299 price tag, over
            1 million consoles were sold, which was groundbreaking back then. the specs of the first<i>Xbox</i> were:
            CPU: Intel Pentium running at 733 MHz. 64 MB memory, 8GB internam HDD, 8MB memory card, and other
            smaller features. The controller for the <i>xbox</i> was a bit infamous for being too large, winning a 
            blunder of the year by guinness world record for its size, and second worst controller. Where <i>Xbox</i>
            tried really hard to sell in was Japan, an econonmy that was dominated by Nintendo. Although they 
            offered a well recieved console in other parts of the world, it struggled to sell in Japan, and
            ended up not being profitable for them. additionally to that, the country was more well recieved to 
            smaller products.

        <h1>The Xbox 360</h1>
        <p class=two>
            The <i>Xbox 360</i> was the next released version of the Xbox. this new and upgraded version sold 84M
            consoles, but it was famous for a fatal problem. Many gamers who used the xbox <i>360</i> are familiar 
            with the red ring of death. when the xbox encountered a fatal software problem, it was completely
            lock and shut down, leaving only a red ring to show users that it had encountered a problem.
            Xbox had to extend its warranty and fix many xbox's in order to counter this, which was not good. 
            Other than this, it was a relative sucess, and they even developed a kinect peice for it for live
            motion gaming. In addition to the previous console, the <i>360</i> offered an HDMI cable, S/PDIF, Sterio audio,
            Composite audio, and other places to plug stuff in for usage. in terms of sales, it did relatively well 
            across the world, and was even considered to have build a solid foundation in the gaming industry due to 
            its incredible sales. Other companies such as Nintendo had their consoled however, such as the Wii, 
            which was a huge success, selling more units that the Xbox, however, their sales later diminished due 
            to the Wii U, which was considered a flop. Due to the presence of the Wii however, Xbox failed to launch
            well in Japan. The PS3 failed considerably in sales, since it lacked any quality games. a few games that it
            had planned to sell as exlusive also failed, as Xbox managed to aquire them too.

    <h1>The Xbox 1</h1>
        <p class=three>
            The <i>Xbox 1</i> was the third installation in the Xbox Series, and was branded as a "starting over" 
            instead of the theorised Xbox 720. Over all the Xbox one boasted much better graphics than its previous
            console, and they even believed it could rival the mega giant which was the PS4, however there was a
            small problem with the <i>xbox 1</i>. Its ability to play games live had a price tag, something the PS4 didnt, 
            so many people ended up opting for the PS4. unfortunatly for xbox too, they presented their console first,
            at a $500 price tag, and later that night, SONY, creaters of the PS4, revealed that their console would be
            $400 and have free access to live games. after that announcemenet, Xbox said they would change some of the 
            online requirments and fees. Overall though, the Xbox was found to be slightly better in terms of hardware,  
            with a stronger system overall. The Xbox also boasted HDR support and 4K blue-ray player. The xbox one 
            also hosted Kinect 2.0, which was a motion sensor that allowed you to play games that required more than 
            pressing and moving buttons on a controller. This, however, was removed from the Xbox bundle, which was not 
            originally the plan, as Microsoft wanted people to first have the Xbox, and then ramp it up to the Kinect
            when they had the money. One of the features that other Xbox consoles had too was backwards compactability.
            You were able to play older games on the newer consoles if it was possible. this allowed Some more nostalgic
            players to relive some of the older games, although support for live was mostly limited.

    <h1>A Good and Bad Situation, cross platform</h1>
        <p class= four> Microsoft offered a <i>game pass</i> that you could renew at a set time for access to content. this content 
            included a large list of games, as well as movies and other smaller features. Now the thing with the 
            gamepass was that you could use this on computers and other devices, and thus, you could play microsoft 
            games on other devices and not just the Xbox. While this was great for the customer, as they could be 
            flexable and not be locked on their device, in terms of sales, Xbox was always lower than PS4 because 
            some people opted to not use the Xbox, along with the fact that the PS4 was overall rated to be better
            and more reliable, considering its competitions previous xbox was infamous for its red ring of death.
            With all this however, Microsoft made a neat addition to possibly buffer their profits, which was 
            cross platform playing, enabling PC users to play with Xbox users. One of the better things about This
            for the user however, was the ability to have one microsoft account for everything. This did make it alot 
            easier for users overall, and prevented some hassles and multiple accounts that other users would of needed.
            One of the strongest standing parts of the Xbox <i>game pass</i> was Halo, included in the <i>game pass</i>, this game had 
            been an iconic symbol of Xbox, being exlusive only to them. It had carried the ealier consoles in terms of content,
            and was one of the larger reasons as to why many gamers chose the Xbox. throughout its life the Xbox continued
            to maintain its main game as a symbol of Xbox, and added it to the gamepass.

    <h1>The Current Console, Xbox X</h1>
        <p class=five> The <i>Xbox X</i> was the next and current addition to the market, boasting 6DDR6 RAM, 12 TFLOPS of GPU power,
            an NVMe SSD, and 8k resolution. Although competing with the beast that is the PS5, they speculate it could
            be the most powerful console on the market, and possibly the world. It ditched the slim design of its 
            previous consoles to opt for a box tower. In terms of games, Xbox is also trying to compete with the 
            rising game software Stadia, which is a cloud bases sytem which acts like a "netflix for games". In terms of 
            Sales, both are really good, but the PS5 has continued to sell more devices. as of right now, both are extremely
            hard to get, since their both out of stock due to COVID-19, a pandemic which had caused a mass drought in 
            hardware parts. In terms of the software, the <i>Xbox X</i> has opted for a faster expericence, often boasting
            to be twice as fast as the precedor. Although this is good, they did have to cut the memory by 40%. In terms
            of controllers, its overall the same, as there isnt much of a difference, but they did add a share button, 
            something that Nintendo and Sony have. In terms of critics, they have overall praised the console for its great
            specs, and they overall consider it the better unit. as good as it is though, they do struggle in the games
            that they offer, since the PS5 does beat them in that. As usual, It hasnt sold that great in Japan, which is something
            the Console often tries to do.
